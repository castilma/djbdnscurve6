.TH djbdnscurve6: tinydns 8
.SH NAME
tinydns \- CurveDNS enabled DNS content server
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tinydns
accepts iterative DNS queries
from hosts around the Internet,
and responds with locally configured information.
Encrypted DNS queries in the 
.I DNSCurve
format are supported when the name server's
.I public key
is generated by means of
.B dnscurve-keygen
and used as primary DNS name for
.IR tinydns .
.SH CONFIGURATION
Normally 
.B tinydns
is set up by the
.B tinydns-conf
program.

.B tinydns
runs chrooted in the directory
specified by the 
.I $ROOT
environment variable,
under the uid and gid
specified by the 
.I $UID
and 
.I $GID
environment variables.

.B tinydns
listens for incoming UDP packets
addressed to port 53 of 
.IR $IP .
It does not listen for TCP queries.
Specifying
.I 0.0.0.0 
or 
.I ::
results in listing to all available
IP adresses and interfaces (for IPv6) 
respectively. In case
.I $IP
is specified as the pseudo IP address
.IR :0 ,
.B tinydns 
is forced to bind to all available IPv4 and IPv6
addresses simultaneously.

.B tinydns
answers queries
as specified by 
.IR data.cdb ,
a binary file created by
.BR tinydns-data .
.SH "FURTHER DETAILS"
.B tinydns
rejects
zone-transfer requests,
inverse queries, non-Internet-class queries, truncated packets, and
packets that contain anything other than a single query.

.BR tinydns ,
like BIND,
includes NS records with answers to most queries.
This increases DNS packet sizes,
but it draws queries away from parent servers,
and reduces the frequency of long DNS delays.
With the default 
.B tinydns-data 
cache times,
a client that uses a normal record at least once every day
will always have the corresponding NS records cached
and will never have to talk to parent servers.

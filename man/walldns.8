.TH djbdnscurve6: walldns 8
.SH NAME
walldns \- DNSCurve enabled reverse DNS wall server
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B walldns
is a reverse DNS wall.
It accepts iterative DNS queries for 
.I in-addr.arpa
and
.I ip6.arpa
domains
from hosts around the Internet,
and supplies generic responses that avoid revealing local host information.
Encrypted DNS queries in the 
.I DNSCurve
format are honored and replied encrypted als well,
given, the name server's
.I public key
is generated by means of
.B dnscurve-keygen
and used as primary DNS name for
.IR walldns .

For example, 
.B walldns
provides a PTR record for 
.I 4.3.2.1.in-addr.arpa
showing 
.I 4.3.2.1.in-addr.arpa
as the name of IP address 
.IR 1.2.3.4 ,
and a matching A record showing 
.I 1.2.3.4
as the IP address of 
.IR 4.3.2.1.in-addr.arpa .
IPv6 addresses are treated similarly, but now using
.I ip6.arpa
as reverse IPv6 address suffix.

.SH CONFIGURATION
Normally 
.B walldns
is set up by the
.B walldns-conf
program.

.B walldns
runs chrooted in the directory
specified by the 
.I $ROOT
environment variable,
under the uid and gid
specified by the 
.I $UID
and 
.I $GID
environment variables.

.B walldns
listens for incoming UDP packets
addressed to port 53 of 
.IR $IP .
It does not listen for TCP queries.
Specifying
.I 0.0.0.0
or 
.I ::
results in listing to all available
IP addresses and interfaces (for IPv6)
respectively.  In case
.I $IP
is specified as the pseudo IP address
.IR :0 ,
.B walldns
will bind to all available IPv4 and IPv6
addresses simultaneously.

.SH "FURTHER DETAILS"
.B walldns
rejects
inverse queries, non-Internet-class queries, truncated packets,
packets that contain anything other than a single question,
queries for domains outside 
.I in-addr.arpa 
and 
.I ip6.arpa
and request types other than A, AAAA, PTR, and *.

.B walldns
does not include NS or SOA records with its responses.

.B walldns
uses TTLs slightly over one week.
